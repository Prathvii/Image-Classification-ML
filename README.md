# Image Classification Project

## Description

This project involves building a machine learning model to classify images into one of 50 classes. The model is trained on a large dataset and can accurately identify the category of an input image. The project leverages Python for data processing, model training, and inference.

## Features

- **Image Classification**: Classifies input images into one of 50 predefined classes.
- **Model Training**: Utilizes a large dataset for training the model to ensure high accuracy.
- **Preprocessing**: Includes image preprocessing steps to prepare the data for model training.
- **Inference**: Provides a script to classify new images using the trained model.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Deep learning framework for model training
- **NumPy**: Library for numerical computations
- **Pandas**: Library for data manipulation and analysis
- **OpenCV**: Library for image processing
- **Matplotlib**: Library for plotting and visualization

# Image Classification Project

## Installation

### Navigate to the project directory.
```bash
cd image-classification-project
```

### Create a virtual environment and activate it.
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### Install the required packages.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset

### Download the dataset:
You can download the dataset from [link-to-dataset]. Ensure the dataset is organized in the following structure:
```bash
dataset/
    train/
        class1/
        class2/
        ...
        class50/
    test/
        class1/
        class2/
        ...
        class50/
```

## Training the Model

### Run the training script.
```bash
python train.py
```

### Adjust hyperparameters:
You can adjust hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and epochs in the `train.py` script.

## Classifying Images

### Run the inference script to classify new images.
```bash
python classify.py --image path_to_image
```

### The script will output the predicted class for the input image.
