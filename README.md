# Image Classification Project

## Description

This project involves building a machine learning model to classify images into one of 50 classes. The model is trained on a large dataset and can accurately identify the category of an input image. The project leverages Python for data processing, model training, and inference.

## Features

- **Image Classification**: Classifies input images into one of 50 predefined classes.
- **Model Training**: Utilizes a large dataset for training the model to ensure high accuracy.
- **Preprocessing**: Includes image preprocessing steps to prepare the data for model training.
- **Inference**: Provides a script to classify new images using the trained model.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Deep learning framework for model training
- **NumPy**: Library for numerical computations
- **Pandas**: Library for data manipulation and analysis
- **OpenCV**: Library for image processing
- **Matplotlib**: Library for plotting and visualization

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository to your local machine.**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-classification-project.git
Navigate to the project directory.

bash
Copy code
cd image-classification-project
Create a virtual environment and activate it.

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required packages.

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Dataset
Download the dataset: You can download the dataset from [link-to-dataset]. Ensure the dataset is organized in the following structure:
bash
Copy code
dataset/
    train/
        class1/
        class2/
        ...
        class50/
    test/
        class1/
        class2/
        ...
        class50/
Training the Model
Run the training script.

bash
Copy code
python train.py
Adjust hyperparameters: You can adjust hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and epochs in the train.py script.

Classifying Images
Run the inference script to classify new images.

bash
Copy code
python classify.py --image path_to_image
The script will output the predicted class for the input image.
